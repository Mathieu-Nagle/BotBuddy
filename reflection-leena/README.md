# HW5 - Reflection By Leena Domadia

### Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?

When it came to our bot design and architecture, one of the most helpful tool we used was storyboarding. Storyboarding allowed us to see and validate how our users, including students and teachers, would use our bot in practice. We were able to physically draw what the problem was that we were trying to solve as well as displaying how our solution can benefit. Additonally, storyboarding help us as developers stay on the same page of how we want to design our bot, what it will look like, and how it would function. We took reference of exisiting Slack App features and decided which ones would be beneficial to include in BotBuddy. We then used those features in our storyboard illustration!

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part figuring out where to make BotBuddy. Our original idea was to make BotBuddy inside Zoom or Google Meets so students would be greeted by a friendly bot when they enter a virtual classroom. Features in this design included BotBuddy encouraging the student to turn on their camera and ask questions when they were confused or needed clarification. However, upon doing some research, we found that it would be very difficult to make a bot on Zoom or Google Meets because there isn't a lot of documentation or information in their APIs to use. Additionally, many of the features we wanted to include in our bot were in beta or did not exist. We then changed our plan to make a bot on Slack where teachers can create and post questions and students can answer the question to receive a funny gif as a celebration. I don't think there is anything different we would do. If we were able to ingetrate BotBuddy from Slack to Zoom or Google Meets, that would be something we would be very interested to do! For now though, BotBuddy on Slack would have to be used in conjuction with Zoom or Google Meets.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would definitely use storyboarding again for another project in the future. Especially working on the project remotely with my teammate, it is extremely important that we both have the concept of design of our bot. I struggled with this in a project last year where one teammate had a different idea of how the website would look and function than the ideas of the rest of group, which made collaboration and development difficult since we were developing two different things. Storyboarding helps in making sure everyone in the group agrees on the same design and architecture of the project.
