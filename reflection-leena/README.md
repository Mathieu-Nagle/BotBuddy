# HW5 - Reflection By Leena Domadia

### Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?

When it came to our bot design and architecture, one of the most helpful tool we used was storyboarding. Storyboarding allowed us to see and validate how our users, including students and teachers, would use our bot in practice. We were able to physically draw what the problem was that we were trying to solve as well as displaying how our solution can benefit. Additonally, storyboarding help us as developers stay on the same page of how we want to design our bot, what it will look like, and how it would function. We took reference of exisiting Slack App features and decided which ones would be beneficial to include in BotBuddy. We then used those features in our storyboard illustration!

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part figuring out where to make BotBuddy. Our original idea was to make BotBuddy inside Zoom or Google Meets so students would be greeted by a friendly bot when they enter a virtual classroom. Features in this design included BotBuddy encouraging the student to turn on their camera and ask questions when they were confused or needed clarification. However, upon doing some research, we found that it would be very difficult to make a bot on Zoom or Google Meets because there isn't a lot of documentation or information in their APIs to use. Additionally, many of the features we wanted to include in our bot were in beta or did not exist. We then changed our plan to make a bot on Slack where teachers can create and post questions and students can answer the question to receive a funny gif as a celebration. I don't think there is anything different we would do. If we were able to ingetrate BotBuddy from Slack to Zoom or Google Meets, that would be something we would be very interested to do! For now though, BotBuddy on Slack would have to be used in conjuction with Zoom or Google Meets.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would definitely use storyboarding again for another project in the future. Especially working on the project remotely with my teammate, it is extremely important that we both have the concept of design of our bot. I struggled with this in a project last year where one teammate had a different idea of how the website would look and function than the ideas of the rest of group, which made collaboration and development difficult since we were developing two different things. Storyboarding helps in making sure everyone in the group agrees on the same design and architecture of the project.

### Implementation
1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

The Slack API, Bolt API, Firebase API, and GitHub were the most helpful when it came to implementation, testing, and integration in our bot project. Slack API was very resourceful in its heavy documentation, but there were a few things missing from it. They had many pages that were outdated, so looking for exactly what we needed took longer than expected. Additionally, there weren't any code examples which made it difficult to implement the features for our project. I figured out we needed a framework to build our bot easier, so we were able to find Bolt, a framework used to build apps specifically on Slack! Its API is super helpful in finding how to implement the exact features we wanted in our bot. We used Firebase to store the questions data of our users and GitHub was used for collaboration, tracking issues, and integration of different features.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part was setting it up. Looking outside the Slack API, we tried finding tutorials for setting up our bot on Slack. But many of the tutorials were outdated and the ones that worked didn't explain how to implement the other features we would want. Finding the Bolt API was definitely a lifesaver. It made implementing the features of our bot much easier. If we had any questions about any features we want to implement, we reached out to the Slack Help Center, and they responded very quickly. As far as doing anything differently, nothing really comes to mind. Almost everything we wanted to implement, we were able to do besides implmenting a time limit for answering a question.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would love to make more bots/apps on Slack using Bolt! It was so much fun making this bot and it was fairly straightforward to implement. I demoed our bot on my two younger cousins, and they really enjoyed answering the questions on Slack. Overall, this was a very fun and exciting project and I'm extremely happy with the end result.

### Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

Kanban and code review was helpful in staying organized in our project. We knew what features we wanted to add to our bot, so we easily were able to turn those into issues and upon making a pull request, we can link those issues to the pull request so that they close when the pull request is merged. Milestones were also helpful in keeping track of each iteration of our project, one for each use case. It made all the issues organized under the specific milestone, or use case, they were needed for.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The one thing we would maybe do differently is set up the GitHub Project Board much earlier. We didn't know we had to set it up earlier than we did, but as far as collaboration, we didn't run into any issues at all. We also didn't set up automation early in the project, only setting it up later. We weren't sure of how to implement automation and early in the project we were hesitant to implement it. However, if we had set it up in the beginning of the project, it would have made the project much more organized.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would definitely use a kanban board to keep track of the features we want to implement. It was very useful in keeping track of anything that needs to be done, what has already been started on, and what is already completed. In our group of two, we weren't able to see the effects we would have if we were working in a larger group. For larger groups and teams, having a kanban board is essential for organization and collaboration.
