2. Start by typing `/createquestion` in the #general channel message box and then press enter. This should pull up a modal that will allow you to enter a question. Fill in each of the required fields and then click submit. BotBuddy should then send you a message saying `<Question Title> saved!`. (This completes uses case 1)
