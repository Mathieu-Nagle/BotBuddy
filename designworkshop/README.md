Questions
1) The two seed ideas we would like to work on are the RewardBot and the FocusBot.
2) 
a) The FocusBot will be trying to solve difficulties associated with online learning, particularly with grade school students. The RewardBot with will work in conjunction with the FocusBot to help encourage students to participate with reactions and emojis that will make learning fun.

b) In the age of COVID-19, online learning has become the norm for students across the world. It was unexpected and schools were not readily prepared to teach young students online. Thus, students are struggling stay focused and connected to the learning material, as well as participating and interacting in class with their peers. After one year, this is a problem that still persists and we need to find a way to help students enjoy school once again.

3) 

a) Our core idea is to make online learning more engadging for young students who are using products like Google Classroom. We intend to create a bot that will link up with similar products to encourage and give positive renforcement to participate in class and stay on top of their work.

b) Notifiers, Reactors, Responders might be useful patterns in designing this bot. Notifiers could be used to send broadcast messages and alerts to all students. Reactors could be used to thank or applaud a student for turn on their camera or participating in class. We could use responders to monitor the chat and congradulate students for answering a question correctly and log responses for teachers to review.

c) See [Storyboard](Storyboard.pdf), and [Flow Diagram 1](Flow_Diagram_1.PNG).
