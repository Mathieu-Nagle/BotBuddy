Questions
1) The two seed ideas we would like to work on are the RewardBot and the FocusBot.
2) a) The FocusBot will be trying to solve difficulties associated with online learning, particularly with grade school students. The RewardBot with will work in conjunction with the FocusBot to help encourage students to participate with reactions and emojis that will make learning fun.
2) b) In the age of COVID-19, online learning has become the norm for students across the world. It was unexpected and schools were not readily prepared to teach young students online. Thus, students are struggling stay focused and connected to the learning material, as well as participating and interacting in class with their peers. After one year, this is a problem that still persists and we need to find a way to help students enjoy school once again.
