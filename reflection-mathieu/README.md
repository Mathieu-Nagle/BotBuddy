# HW5 - Reflection By Mathieu Nagle

### Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project? <br>
The most helpful part of the design process was the storyboard. In our storyboard, we set out a very clear idea of how we wanted the bot to work and look. Throughout the rest of the project, we were constantly referring to it and working with that vision in mind.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently? <br>
The most difficult part of the design process was creating an architecture design when we still didn't fully understand exactly how Slack bots work. If I were to do things differently I would have done more research into Slack bots and maybe have even made some basic code so I could see it working in front of me.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project? <br>
A design method that I might want to try in a future project is coming up with clear use cases. They were a great way of tracking our progress when making the bot. They were also very important in helping us decide what code to prioritize.

### Implementation
1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project? <br>
The most helpful thing that I used for testing and implementation were programs called ngrok and nodemon. Ngrok allows you to create a URL that makes your local host output readable by the Slack API. Nodemon is a program that allows you to edit your code and implement it emidiatly without having to restart the node.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently? <br>
The most difficult part of creating the bot was getting started. While there is an extreme amount of documentation on creating a Slack a lot of it is very outdated and contradictory material. This made it very difficult to get the initial features of the bot working but once that was done much of the documentation was very helpful.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project? <br>
I'm going to use ngrok and nodemon in the future. I'm also going to be sure to check out what documentation different sites have for their APIs.

### Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project? <br>
The most helpful thing was in implementing was the GitHub projects feature. Using this alongside GitHub issues allowed us to track our progression through each use case and function.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently? <br>
The most difficult part for me was getting used to these different GitHub features and thinking of them when I was working on the code.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project? <br>
I might want to use the GitHub issues feature more in the future. I like how you can assign them to different milestones and give them different tags. I also like how you can link pull requests to them so everything is in one place.

### Overall
Overall this project has been a great learning experience when it comes to coding best practices. While it at times felt tedious the step-by-step process of designing and implementing this project made me appreciate everything that goes into making a good application. I still have a lot of learning to do but thanks to this project I have a much greater appreciation for the planning phase of a coding project.
